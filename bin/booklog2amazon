=head1 NAME

booklog2amazon - Update amazon recommended according to booklog status

=head1 VERSION

version v0.0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Without argument, configuration is read from ~/.booklog2amazon.yaml
  booklog2amazon
  
  # Override configuration
  booklog2amazon myconfig.yaml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reads from status in L<Booklog|http://booklog.jp/> and update Amazon recommended configuration according to the status.

~/.booklog2amazon.yaml is a YAML file as the followings:

  amazon:
    email: your_email@example.com
    password: your_password
  booklog:
    account: your_account

This includes sensitive information so you should set appropriate permissions.
After the first execution, C<last_sync> is added to the file. So, write permission is also necessary.

=head1 CAVEATS

=over 4

=item *

Currently, all items you registered to booklog are considered that you owned them even though their status is 'want read'.

=item *

Currently, it is assumed that rank is set at read time.

=item *

This script stores the last executed time into configuration file and skips the items registered/read before. So, if you set read time of some items prior to the last executed time, they are skipped.
